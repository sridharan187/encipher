        <h2><center>About Me</center></h2>
        <p align="center">
            Hello! I am someone who is beginning my journey into web development.  
            I enjoy learning new skills, exploring technology, and building simple but meaningful projects 
            that help me grow as a developer.

       <center> <h2>Why Do I Want to Learn HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            I want to learn HTML because it is the basic building block of all websites.  
            Understanding HTML helps me know how the web works and how content is displayed in a browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning HTML gives me the ability to create my own pages from scratch.  
            It allows me to bring my ideas to life and develop the foundation for more advanced web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML is simple, powerful, and essential for anyone who wants to start a career in web development.  
            By mastering HTML first, I can confidently move on to CSS and JavaScript later.
